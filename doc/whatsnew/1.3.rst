  What's New in PySCF 1.3
***************************

This article explains new features in PySCF 1.3 alpha, compared to PySCF 1.2.
PySCF 1.2 was released on Nov 7, 2016.


Relase highlights
=================

New features:

* Quantum chemistry ECP for solid
* AO-direct CCSD
* CI coefficients transformation for one-particle basis rotation
* CIAH second order SCF solver for PBC KRHF and KUHF
* Dynamically tune active space using DMET-CAS decomposition
* CISD and CISD 1, 2-particle density matrices
* Selected-CI and Selected-CI 1, 2-particle density matrices

Improvements:

* Optimized CCSD(T)
* Change the default kpts mesh (to always include gamma point)


API changes
===========

* In PySCF 1.2, :func:`Cell.make_kpts` generated k-points uniformly along each
  direction.  Gamma point might be excluded in the so-generated k-points when
  the number of k-points is even.  In PySCF 1.3, a shift is applied to the
  k-points so that gamma point are always included.
